Phase I: Development tools
==========================
In this section will talk about the essential tools that every developer uses.

Virtual Machine
----------------

Definition
^^^^^^^^^^
    In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a particular
    computer system. Virtual machines operate based on the computer architecture
    and functions of a real or hypothetical computer, and their implementations
    may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of both [#w1]_.

Software
^^^^^^^^

- VirtualBox

- VMware

- LinuxKVM

- etc...

We will focus entirely on `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_. After you
download and install the virtualization software you need to download an image
of an operating system. We will use `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`_ in this
course.

After you download the `ISO image <http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?country=--&version=14.04.1&architecture=amd64>`_
you need to ``Create a Virtual Machine``, configure the RAM to be allocated for
it, configure a hard drive for the image,

Command Line Interface
----------------------
Command Line Interface or CLI is the fastest way of communicating with a
computer. CLI can retrive data from the current system or run a task on a remote
server. Also, CLI provides a way to run periodic commands and runs long running
commands in the background, ``Daemons``,.

In this chapter, we will discover the import commands, and we will learn you to
use them. After opening up a terminal in Ubuntu, type in the following command
``ls``. As you can see in the terminal, a list of files and directories showed
up. ``ls`` a command to list the contant of the current directory.
