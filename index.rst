Welcome to Full Stack Development's documentation!
==================================================

In this course we will discover the Full stack Development/Engineering. The
course is divided into three main parts development tools, team project
workflow, and complete web development. The objective of the course is to make
you familier with the terminology and the tools that are used.

The first week we will talk about the essential tools to build a project. The
tools focus on the main interaction between you, the developer and your machine.
The more you know about your machine the faster you become at fixing problems.

The second week we will focus on the interactions between you and your peers.
Because of the fact that all big projects are done in teams, we would like to
define the tools that help team achieve fast development environment
replication. Also, we will know that fast development is measured by the average
velocity of all team members not by an individual velocity. We will also try to
increase the `Bus-factor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor>`_ of the team.

The third course is going to take two weeks which we will try to make you
more familiar with the tools and have a demo project for you to work on. The
course will focus on the automated deployment and replication of the development
environment in the production machines. Also, The course will talk about the
best design architecture of web application, the performance bottel necks and
best practices. The course will compare between IAAS and PAAS and how to take
advantage of them.
