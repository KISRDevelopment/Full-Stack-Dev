Welcome to Full Stack Development's documentation!
==================================================

In this course we will explore the concept of Full Stack Development. The
course is divided into three main parts:

- Development Tools

- Team Project Workflow

- Complete Web development

The objective of the course is to make you familiar with the terminology
and the tools that are used in modern web development.

The first week will be about the essential tools required to build a project and 
set up a local environment. The focus is on the interaction between you, 
the developer and your machine. The more you know about your machine the faster you 
become at fixing problems.

The second week we will focus on the interactions between you and your peers.
It is a fact of modern development that all big projects are done in teams and
development velocity is measured by the average velocity of all team members,
not the velocity of any individual. In this week we will introduce some of the
tools that help developers work simulataneously and effectively.
Team development is all about increasing the `Bus-factor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor>`_ 
of your team.

The third course is going to take two weeks. We will try to make you
more familiar with the tools from the first two weeks by working through
a demo project. We will introduce the concpets of automated deployment and
replication of the development environment in production machines. This course 
will discuss best practices when it comes to design architecture of web applications.
We will also compare between IAAS and PAAS and how to take advantage of them.
