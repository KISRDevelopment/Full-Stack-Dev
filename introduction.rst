The industry definition of a Full Stack Developer is an engineer who can work on 
different levels of an application stack. 
The term stack refers to the combination of components and tools that make up the 
application. The components could be in the front-end or the back-end of the system.

The main objective of full stack engineer is to keep every part of the system
running smoothly. A Full Stack Developer can performs tasks ranging from resizing an 
image or text in a webpage to patching the kernel.

Current application architecture
--------------------------------
The new applications are developed to be installed in mobile devices or hosted
on the web. This trend caused by increase of internet speed, fast growing
social networks, and faster applications. This trend created the need to rethink
application development from an isolated desktop application to an interactive
and collaborative web hosted application. Also, we have seen the big shift in
the web from HTML 4 to HTML5 which has built-in APIs to help you accomplish
many tasks to built a richer web application. An example of this would be
`Polymer <https://www.polymer-project.org/>`_,
`AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_,
`React <http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html>`_, and many more.

These changes improve the web application substantially, and they were led by
the fast growing web frameworks e.g. `NodeJS <http://nodejs.org/>`_,
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_,
`RoR <http://rubyonrails.org/>`_ ...etc. Each one of them focused on one problem
or more and provided their solution; IO bound, maintainability and scalability
of the web application ..etc.
