Current application architecture
--------------------------------
The new applications are developed to be installed in mobile devices or hosted
on the web. This trend caused by increase of internet speed, fast growing
social networks, and faster applications. This trend created the need to rethink
application development from an isolated desktop application to an interactive
and collaborative web hosted application. Also, we have seen the big shift in
the web from HTML 4 to HTML5 which has built-in APIs to help you accomplish
many tasks to built a richer web application. An example of this would be
`Polymer <https://www.polymer-project.org/>`,
`AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`,
`React <http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html>`, and many more.

These changes improve the web application substantially, and the changes led by
the fast growing web frameworks e.g. `NodeJS <http://nodejs.org/>`,
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`,
`RoR <http://rubyonrails.org/>` ...etc.
