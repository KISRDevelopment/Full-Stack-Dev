Modern Application Architecture
--------------------------------
Modern applications are developed to be installed on mobile devices or hosted
on the web. This is a result of trends in faster internet speeds, greater web
access and penetration, and the development of more powerful mobile devices.
This has created the need to rethink application development so that a single
back-end infrastructure can serve a variety of front-end clients.
