Phase III: Complete Web Development
###################################

Introduction
============

The purpose of the workshop
---------------------------

At this point in the course we have all the tools and workflows
we would need to do the following:

    - Manually set up a development environment
    - Manually set up a stack on any machine
    - Collaborate on a project remotely

In this workshop, through the process of building and deploying 
and actual live web application, we will learn to automate and
streamline those processes.

**Phase III: Complete Web Development** will help put you in
a position to collaboratively develop a live web application
which can be shared, deployed, and installed by anyone from 
anywhere to any machine.

What's covered
--------------

**Vagrant** will help you automate setting up multiple, identical
virtual development environments and share those settings with
your team.

**Ansible** will help you automate the provisioning and
deployment of your application to any machine and share those 
settings with your team.

**Python** and **Django** - We will introduce the basics of 
Python and the Django framework and let you take it from there!

**Toy Project** - This workshop will revolve around an actual
Django toy project that we will develop, deploy and iterate on over
the duration of this course.
