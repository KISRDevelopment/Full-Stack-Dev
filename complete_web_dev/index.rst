In this chapter we will give a introduction into Python, Django, Vegrant and
Ansible. Those tools will help you automate the build and deploy process. We
will talk about them in a week long, and by the end of that week you should be
comfortable with them.

The second week of this course you will have a toy project to do with your
class mates. Please click on the link below to read the details of the project.
