Python
******
Python is an  general purpose object oriented programming language that was
created by `Guido Van Rossum <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum>`_.
The language has many implementations e.g. `CPython
<https://www.python.org/>`_, `Jython <http://www.jython.org/>`_, `Pypy
<http://pypy.org/>`_, ...etc. We focus on the CPython implementaion in this
course, and feel free to check the rest of them out.

Python is widly used programing language, therefore it is being taught by many
schools as an introductory programming language in computer science classes. In
this course we will try to teach you how to use it.

From now on when we use the word **Python** we mean the **CPython**
implementation of the **Python** programming language
