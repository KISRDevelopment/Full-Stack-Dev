Vagrant
#######

In :doc: `Phase I </development_tools/index>` we learned how to:

    - Setup individual virtual machines
    - Setup an environment with the software packages we needed
    - Configure and network our machines
    - Configure a basic stack

And we did it all **manually** and **individually**!

**Vagrant** is a tool that changes all of that by providing us with 
a way **automate** the entire process using a single file that we can
share along with the project code.

Tutorial
========

We will be following the `official vagrant tutorial <https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html>`_.
